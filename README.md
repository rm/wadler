## "Monads for functional programming" in Python

This is a Python translation of the code in Philip Wadler's paper, [*Monads for functional programming*](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/monads.html#marktoberdorf)

This contains some interesting code snippets, and I have traced out the output of the State Monad, in [wadler-2.8.trace](./wadler-2.8.trace).
